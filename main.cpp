/// Logic Assignment - Propositional Logic
/// By Bhaskar Ruthvik Bikkina (2021A7PS1345H), Siddhant Srinivas(2021A7PS0050H), Soumil Ray(2021A7PS2652H)
///
/// The assignment has been written and tested on an Asus Zephyrus G14 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS CPU, an NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU, 16GB Dual-channel RAM and 1TB ROM and a Macbook Air 2020 with M1 CPU and GPU, 8GB RAM and 256GB ROM. 
/// The IDE used for the project is Visual Studio 2022 and the code has been written in C++ 20. The code was also written on visual studio code.
/// Doxygen has been used to make the documentation work easier.
/// The project uses a stack class implemented using a Linked-List and a Binary Tree as the Primary Data Structures.
/// "using namespace std" has not been used so as to avoid name clashes with other functions in the STL library. 
/// The memory usage has been tested using the inbuilt profiler in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
/// The time taken by the program to execute has been measured using the chrono library and along with some useful functions from iomanip and ios libraries. It was also cross-checked using Visual Studio 2022.
/// The analysis of the data was done using Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.10 and the libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
